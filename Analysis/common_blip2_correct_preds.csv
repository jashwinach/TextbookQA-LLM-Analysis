It highlights the relationships between different organisms, starting from primary producers like phytoplankton and seaweed at the bottom. Krill feed on these primary producers, while herring and anchovy fish feed on the krill. At the top of the web, a gull is depicted, which preys on the herring and anchovy. Arrows indicate the direction of energy flow from one trophic level to the next.",3,d,2
flow of energy,How many animals are plant consumers?,2,4,3,1,2,../Dataset/test/question_images/food_chains_webs_881.png,No,a diagram of a bird and a plant with the names of each,"The image depicts a simple food web diagram with arrows indicating the flow of energy between organisms. There are four components labeled: ""Plant,"" ""Earthworm,"" ""Chicken,"" and ""Fox."" The diagram shows that plants are eaten by both chickens and earthworms, while chickens are also preyed upon by foxes.",2,a,2
flow of energy,What does the mud crab consume?,Mussels,Sand shrimp,Anchovy,Algae,Mussels,../Dataset/test/question_images/food_chains_webs_896.png,No,a diagram of the life cycle of a fish,"The image shows a simplified food web diagram of a marine ecosystem. It illustrates the feeding relationships between various marine organisms like algae, mysid shrimp, sand shrimp, anchovy, weakfish, Atlantic croaker, mud crab, and mussels. Arrows indicate the direction of energy flow, from the prey to the predator.",Mussels,a,Mussels
flow of energy,How many living organisms participate in this food web?,5,7,8,4,7,../Dataset/test/question_images/food_chains_webs_898.png,No,a diagram of a tree with several different types of trees,"The image shows a simple food web diagram in black and white, representing various organisms and their predatory or feeding relationships. Arrows indicate the direction of energy flow from plants to insects, moles, and squirrels, then to birds like hawks, and from plants directly to rabbits, which are prey for hawks as well.",8,b,7
flow of energy,How many producers are shown in the diagram?,4,1,3,2,1,../Dataset/test/question_images/food_chains_webs_916.png,No,"a drawing of a diagram of a grasshopper, a mouse, and a bird","This image depicts a simple food chain with four links, starting from the producer (grass) and moving up through different trophic levels to primary consumers (grasshopper), to secondary consumers (mouse), and finally to a tertiary consumer (owl). Each organism is represented by a black and white illustration, with arrows indicating the direction of energy flow from one organism to the next.",4,b,1
flow of energy,How many stages are in this life cycle?,2,3,5,6,5,../Dataset/test/question_images/food_chains_webs_6054.png,No,a close up of a diagram of different types of fish,"The image depicts a simplified marine food chain. At the top, there is an orca, labeled as a carnivore, followed by two more levels of fish, each also marked as carnivores. At the bottom, there are illustrations of zooplankton and phytoplankton, with arrows indicating the flow of energy up the food chain from the phytoplankton to the higher trophic levels.",6,c,5
