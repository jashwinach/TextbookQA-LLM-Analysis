Plants like the rosebush and oak tree are at the base of the web, serving as food for herbivores, which in turn are preyed upon by carnivores and omnivores.",1,b,1
flow of energy,What role does the fish play in the given food chain?,Primary consumer,Secondary consumer,Producer,Tertiary consumer,Secondary consumer,../Dataset/test/question_images/food_chains_webs_799.png,No,a diagram of a fish and its life cycle,"The image shows a simple food web diagram with arrows indicating the flow of energy from one organism to another. It includes a water plant, a tadpole, a fish, and a bird. The arrows suggest that the water plant is eaten by the tadpole, the tadpole is prey for the fish, and the bird can eat either the fish or the tadpole.",Secondary consumer,a,Primary consumer
flow of energy,How many birds are depicted in the food web?,1,2,3,4,2,../Dataset/test/question_images/food_chains_webs_812.png,No,a diagram of a food chain with several different types of food,"The image is a diagram representing a food web. It shows the complex interconnections between different species in an ecosystem, indicating who eats what. Arrows point from the prey to the predator, denoting the flow of energy, with animals like coyotes, hawks, snakes, goats, rats, mice, and chickens, and plants like grasses and corn.",2,c.,3
flow of energy,Which one eats green algae?,lobster,mussel,zooplankton,limpet,limpet,../Dataset/test/question_images/food_chains_webs_822.png,No,a diagram of the different types of the human body,"The image shows a simple diagram representing a food chain in an aquatic ecosystem. It illustrates the trophic relationships between species, starting with 'Green algae' as a primary producer. 'Green algae' is shown as a food source for 'Limpet', which in turn is a food source for 'Lobster'. Similarly, 'Phytoplankton' serves as a food source for 'Mussel' and 'Zooplankton', with 'Mussel' also being a food source for 'Lobster'. The arrows indicate the direction of energy flow from one organism to another in the ecosystem.",Limpet,d,limpet
flow of energy,What does the herring eat?,anchovy,krill,gull,phytoplankton,krill,../Dataset/test/question_images/food_chains_webs_861.png,No,a diagram of a fish life cycle with a seagull and other animals,"The image represents a diagram of a coastal food web. It highlights the relationships between different organisms, starting from primary producers like phytoplankton and seaweed at the bottom. Krill feed on these primary producers, while herring and anchovy fish feed on the krill. At the top of the web, a gull is depicted, which preys on the herring and anchovy. Arrows indicate the direction of energy flow from one trophic level to the next.",krill,b,krill
flow of energy,How many animals are plant consumers?,2,4,3,1,2,../Dataset/test/question_images/food_chains_webs_881.png,No,a diagram of a bird and a plant with the names of each,"The image depicts a simple food web diagram with arrows indicating the flow of energy between organisms. There are four components labeled: ""Plant,"" ""Earthworm,"" ""Chicken,"" and ""Fox."" The diagram shows that plants are eaten by both chickens and earthworms, while chickens are also preyed upon by foxes.",2,a,2
flow of energy,What does the mud crab consume?,Mussels,Sand shrimp,Anchovy,Algae,Mussels,../Dataset/test/question_images/food_chains_webs_896.png,No,a diagram of the life cycle of a fish,"The image shows a simplified food web diagram of a marine ecosystem. It illustrates the feeding relationships between various marine organisms like algae, mysid shrimp, sand shrimp, anchovy, weakfish, Atlantic croaker, mud crab, and mussels. Arrows indicate the direction of energy flow, from the prey to the predator.",Mussels,a,Mussels
